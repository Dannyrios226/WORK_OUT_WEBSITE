I chose this data and idea for the webpage because I am really intrested in working out and body building. 
This website is meant to provide you with a workout of your choosing so you dont have to look up any exercises or worry about to do. 
The website also gives you random celeberty workouts that they have done. It is important to remember that it takes a lot to look like these celebs like a perfect diet, perfect coach, performace inhancing drugs, and surgeries to name a few.
That is why it is important to remember you are one of a kind and if you choose to go down a fitness journey the only person you should comapare yourself to and compete with is, you.

I used to weigh 200 lbs and during the pandemic I fell inlove with weightlifting and it has helped me lose weight. my first year I went down to 160lbs  and then I decided that from then on I would go through a bulking faze and a cutting faze where I 
would gain weight and loose wieght throughout the year. Riht now as of 4-9-24 I am in my cutting faze. 

I hope I can share this website with my classmates, family or anyone who is intrested in it and I hope it helps.

A little bit of explenation as to what push pull legs is, it is a split which is simply a workout routine where One day you do Push exercises the next you do Pull and lastly Legs then you rest and continue that routine or split.
